### 🧑‍💼 About Me

I'm a digital transformation consultant and full-stack developer based in **Wiesbaden, Germany** 🇩🇪. With deep expertise in credit risk, compliance, and financial technology, I bridge the gap between business strategy and hands-on engineering.

What sets me apart: **I don't just advise — I build.** Every project below is architected, coded, and deployed by me. From zero to production, including infrastructure, CI/CD, and ongoing operations.

My north star: technology should serve people, not the other way around.

### 💡 What Drives Me

`AI Agents` `Credit Risk` `Fraud Prevention` `KYC/AML` `Compliance` `ESG`  
`Digital Transformation` `RegTech` `FinTech` `People & Leadership`  
`Full-Stack Development` `Browser Automation` `Document AI` `IoT`

I believe the best technology is invisible — it just works, and it makes people's lives easier. Whether it's a risk manager who no longer needs to read 50-page reports, or a marina operator who can manage 200 berths from their phone.
